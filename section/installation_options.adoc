== Installation options ==

You need to have the Chromebook in developer mode to run a custom Linux distribution.

Developer mode also includes a shell that can be used to install a Gentoo system to a USB drive (or SD card for the Samsung ARM Chromebook). Once unpacked, you can chroot into the environment to customise it.

If you have a prepared stage4, or are willing to build upon the upstream stage3, a bootable disk can be prepared from another machine.
