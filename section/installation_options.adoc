== Installation options ==

You need to have the Chromebook in developer mode to run a custom Linux distribution.

Developer mode includes a shell that can be used to install a Gentoo system
to a USB
ifdef::samsung_arm_chromebook.adoc[drive (or SD card for the Samsung ARM Chromebook).]
ifndef::samsung_arm_chromebook.adoc[drive.]

By default, most of the ChromeOS filesystem is mounted read-only.
While it is possible to make more of the system writable and persistant,
locations such as `/home` and `/mnt/stateful_partition` are already writable.

If you have a prepared stage4, or are willing to build upon the upstream stage3,
a bootable disk can be prepared from another machine.
Once unpacked, you can chroot into the environment to customise it.
