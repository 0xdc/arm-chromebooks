You can customise wpa_supplicant further or use wpa_cli as root or, if configured like above, as a user in the 'wheel' group.

==== bindist ====

If you're using a stage3 that was built with `USE=bindist`, wpa_supplicant will not install out-of-the-box
as WPA3 requires `ecdsa` primitives that are blocked by `openssl[bindist]`.

As a minimum, `@system` contains `dev-libs/openssl` and `net-misc/openssh` which must have matching `bindist` flags:

  # emerge -1a openss{l,h}[-bindist]
  # emerge wpa_supplicant
